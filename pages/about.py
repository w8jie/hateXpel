- As the world witnesses a surge in social media, an unintended consequence has been the proliferation of hate comments online.
- Despite so, this rising concern is often left as a second thought.
- Many police reports have been lodged by victims who were harassed either online or in public for their identities.
- Therefore, the pressing need arises for tools like a hate speech classifier, aimed at mitigating the spread and impact of these malignant comments to preserve the delicate balance of Singapore's multicultural society.")

1. **Query Embedding**: Transforms the user's query into a high-dimensional vector through an embedding model.
2. **Vector Database**: Consists of pre-encoded representations of knowledge and captures the context relevance of each document, serving as a rapid lookup mechanism for search queries.
3. **Retriver**: Employs cosine similarity to extract pertinent embeddings from the vector database and their mapped documents based off the input query.
4. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Utilizes a curated set of examples to prime the Large Language Model, guiding its capability to produce contextually rich outputs.
5. **Generate Response**: The final step where the Large Language Model, aided by the retrieved documents from the vector database, synthesizes a comprehensive and sound answer.

This measurement is beneficial, because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine similarity.""")
